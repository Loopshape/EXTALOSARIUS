This prompt is designed to serve as a comprehensive technical specification for a 3D modeler or procedural engine, detailing every known aspect of the AEGIS carrier's construction, function, and internal layout.⚙️ Technical Specification Prompt: AEGIS Heavy Space Carrier (3D Rebuild)Objective: Create a photo-realistic, highly detailed 3D model of the AEGIS Heavy Space Carrier, incorporating all specified functional and structural elements.I. General Specifications & Hull GeometryClassification: Heavy Interstellar Carrier, manned by an 8-person crew ($\text{2}\pi/8$ crew configuration).Scale: Massive, designed for deep space transport and sustained habitat. Assume a primary length of $\approx 150-180$ meters.Form Factor: Tri-hulled, sleek, and streamlined, optimized for both orbital maneuverability and long-range flight.Primary Hull: Long, central spine containing the command and habitat modules.Secondary Hulls (Wings): Two large, slightly swept-back wing-like structures extending from the mid-section, primarily housing radiators, fuel tanks, and the main thruster pylons.Hull Composition: Reinforced Carbon-Nanotube Matrix plating with a Layered Rayforce Shielding Grid visible as subtle geometric lines across the exterior surface. The color scheme is deep grey/white with high-contrast military/research markings in orange and cyan.Exterior Features:Docking Ports: Minimum two primary pressurized docking ports (fore and aft).Radiators: Retractable/deployable high-surface-area heat dissipation panels along the secondary hulls.Sensors/Scanners: Array of Rayforce Scanners and Gravitypeek sensors visibly integrated into the dorsal surface (antenna dishes, planar arrays).II. Propulsion System (The "Hydro-Plasma Drive")This is the central technical element and must be the most detailed area of the model.Principle: Field-Massed Gravity Elevation via Water-Carbonized Refracture. The engine operates by triggering heat on carbon and reacting it with stored water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) and oxygen ($\text{O}_2$).Mechanism: This process creates a Helium to Oxygen by Water Carbonized Refracture which generates high-energy, Atomic-Forced High-Plasma Waves.Thrust Poles: The main engine consists of three large, distinct propulsion nozzles/poles arranged in a triangular cluster at the rear.Control/Maneuverability: Movement (thrust vectoring) is achieved by a complex pulsing pattern: Pulsing 2 of the 3 poles intensely while the remaining 1 pole flickers accordingly to modulate the gravity field shift.Visualization: The nozzles should emit a powerful, concentrated cyan/blue plasma jet. Ensure the internal structure of the poles shows conduits for $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, $\text{O}_2$, and $\text{Carbon}$ injection, leading to a central reaction chamber visible just before the nozzle exit.III. Interior - Command and ControlCockpit (Bridge): Designed for 8 crew members in a semi-circular, tiered arrangement focused on a central command station.Dashboard: Solid transparent window/dashboard providing a panoramic, unobstructed view (as per the description).Seating Hierarchy (Total 8):Center/Aft Tier (5 Coordinator Slots): Central Coordinator (Primary Seat), Adviser, Constellator, Communicator, Marketer.Mid Tier (2 Navigator Slots): Navigator (Left of Coordinator), Predictor (Left of Navigator).Forward Tier (1 Measurement Slot): Doctor (Right of Coordinator).Navigation Tools: Integrate holographic displays of the Gyroscope, Starmap, and Gravitypeek data panels around the Navigator and Predictor stations.IV. Interior - Habitat and UtilityPersonnel Suite (4th Grade):Modular, compact living quarters for the 4th-grade personnel. Must include a bed/rest area, personal terminal/desk, and secure storage for personal effects. Design must emphasize efficiency and multi-functionality due to space constraints.Kitchen/Bath/Utility Core:Kitchen: Compact, zero-G-capable galley/prep area (sealed storage, induction heating units, recycling system).Bath/Shower: Fully enclosed, water-recycling shower/bath unit with a secure closure system.Sub-Pressured Toilet Cabine: A separate, sealed chamber. Must clearly show intake fans and pressure seals necessary for waste management in a low/zero-G environment (maintaining differential pressure for suction/containment).V. Terraformer Colony Labor ModuleFunction: Dedicated laboratory/staging area for pre-deployment terraforming supplies and analysis.Features: Must include several secure containment bays, analysis stations with holographic screens displaying chemical/biological data (simulated), and heavy-duty tool storage. Should appear functional, industrial, and ready for deployment to a harsh exoplanetary environment.
